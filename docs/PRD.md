# ConceptWeave Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product statement

ConceptWeave converts heterogeneous enterprise evidence into a governed ontology and semantic layer without collapsing observed facts, model inference, and human-approved meaning into the same truth state.

## 2. Buyer problem

Enterprise teams repeatedly hand-build business glossaries, ontologies, metric definitions, semantic mappings, and data relationships from database schemas, API contracts, documents, and tribal knowledge. The work is slow, inconsistent across tools, difficult to audit, and unsafe to delegate entirely to an LLM because inferred semantics can be plausible but wrong.

## 3. Primary buyers and users

- enterprise data architects and semantic-modeling teams;
- data governance and catalog teams;
- analytics/BI platform owners;
- AI/RAG platform teams that require governed machine-readable context;
- risk/compliance and enterprise-architecture teams that need traceable semantic models.

## 4. Core job to be done

Given an enterprise source estate, produce a **reviewable semantic model proposal** in which every concept, relationship, constraint, dimension, measure, and physical mapping is linked to exact evidence and can be validated, rejected, reviewed, published, superseded, and reproduced.

## 5. Functional requirements

### FR-1 Source observation

Accept immutable snapshots or versioned contracts for relational schema, OpenAPI, AsyncAPI/event models, documents/glossaries, source-code structure, existing ontology/vocabulary, and lineage/provenance. Raw source authority remains with its owning system.

The first active relational slice defines an immutable PostgreSQL schema-snapshot contract before a live adapter exists. It preserves exact schema/table/column identifiers, source column ordinals, source type/nullability/comment metadata, source-connection reference, snapshot digest, extractor revision, observation-time evidence, PK/unique/FK coordinates, and CHECK-constraint evidence. For foreign keys, observed `ON UPDATE`/`ON DELETE` actions, match type, and deferrability/initial timing are retained as typed source evidence; if the adapter did not observe those fields, the contract retains explicit absence rather than inventing defaults. For CHECK constraints, preserve the PostgreSQL-reconstructed definition together with validation, enforcement, and `NO INHERIT` status; do not infer ordered expression-column coordinates from SQL text. It must not normalize identifiers in ways that erase PostgreSQL quoting or schema boundaries.

### FR-2 Candidate discovery

Produce candidates for concepts, taxonomies, non-taxonomic relations, semantic constraints, dimensions, measures, and physical-to-semantic mappings. Each candidate starts as inferred rather than authoritative.

### FR-3 Evidence and provenance

The current v0.1 candidate contract requires every candidate to retain exact source identity, source digest, and source location through `EvidenceReference`. The active Source Observation slice additionally retains snapshot digest, observation time, extractor revision, typed table/column/constraint locations, foreign-key relationship behavior when observed, and CHECK definition/status evidence. Issue #2 must still add proposal-receipt/discovery-method provenance and bind generated candidates to verified source receipts before the first Generation release. Unsupported candidates fail closed.

### FR-4 Deterministic validation

Validate syntax, identifiers, relationship cardinality, mapping completeness, duplicate/contradictory definitions, ontology consistency where supported, semantic-measure contracts, and publication schema before review.

### FR-5 Governed review

A candidate cannot become authoritative solely because an LLM or automated extractor produced it. The publication lifecycle is Draft -> Proposed -> Validated -> Reviewed -> Published, with explicit rejection and supersession paths.

### FR-6 Publication

Publish versioned artifacts for ontology and semantic-layer consumers while retaining the exact input snapshot and proposal/review receipts that produced the release.

### FR-7 Interoperability

Support stable adapters for `semantic-data-portal`, `LineageWeave`, `context-graph-contracts`, and other CWL products without direct cross-service application-table SQL.

### FR-8 LLM assistance

All LLM-backed induction uses `contextual-orchestrator`. Model output is untrusted proposal data and may not skip deterministic validation or review.

## 6. First vertical slice

Relational schema snapshot -> observed tables/columns/constraints -> concept/relation/dimension/measure/mapping candidates -> evidence-bound validation report -> reviewable proposal package.

## 7. Non-goals for v0.1

- replacing `semantic-data-portal` as the enterprise catalog;
- arbitrary write access to source systems;
- automatic publication without review;
- treating vector similarity as semantic truth;
- copying every external ontology into one CWL namespace;
- building a generic LLM gateway or browser crawler;
- claiming an emerging draft semantic-layer format is a stable standard.

## 8. Acceptance criteria for the first commercial candidate

- 100% owned production line/function/region and branch coverage where tooling exposes it;
- candidate-to-source provenance completeness of 100%;
- zero publication paths that bypass reviewed state;
- zero silent inferred-to-authoritative promotion;
- deterministic replay of the same immutable source snapshot and extraction configuration;
- cross-tenant access denial when tenancy is introduced;
- malformed/hostile source contracts rejected with bounded resource use;
- semantic-model release can be reproduced from source receipts and approved proposal receipts;
- buyer can inspect why each published artifact exists and which evidence supported it.
